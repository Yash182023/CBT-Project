# CBT-Project

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive system for assessing the psychological well-being of patients through user interactions. The integration of C++ and Python forms a robust backend, while the incorporation of Data Structures and Algorithms provides a strong algorithmic foundation. The program is organized into four distinct classes, each tailored to address specific psychological conditions: the first class handles basic questions, the second pertains to PTSD-related inquiries, the third to ADHD, and the fourth to BPD. These questions are efficiently managed using a HashMap, and the classes employ functions to store user responses in a queue. The addition of weighted values transforms this queue into a priority queue, and the resulting answers are subsequently stored in separate CSV files, forming the dataset for analysis. Machine learning techniques, such as train-test splitting, are then employed to partition the data for model training and evaluation. Classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, are applied to make predictions. The development environment comprises Google Colab and VS Code, ensuring a robust and collaborative platform for project implementation.
